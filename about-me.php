					<h2>All about me</h2>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
						I am a creative developer, photographer, designer, and filmmaker. I love doing anything that challenges me, or puts me out of my comfort zone and makes me think.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have always been a very creative, and artistic person. I have never been good at traditional art, so I turned to digital media and really began to thrive. I started off at a young age with a camera, filming different videos and short skits with friends and family. From there, I got into photography and design. These different mediums acted as a creative outlet for me at a young age. These passions eventually led me to SAIT, where I get to learn full time about everything I love to do. It has introduced me to new areas of design, as well as helping me improve my skills in areas that I was already good in. I am excited to get out in the industry and begin making a name for myself. I believe that having a passion in something can take you as far as you want to go! Sky is the limit when you are passionate.
