					<h2>Conception</h2>
					<h5>the inspiration</h5>
					<p>
						When I was 16 I bought my first project car, with big plans to turn it into my forever car. I spent countless hours thinking of what I was going to change or modify on the car. I wasnâ€™t sure what the best way to do that was, so I decided to use my design skills to design the car digitally. From there I actually was able to start a small business creating designs for other people. My biggest client being a racing magazine out of the States. In short, this project was created to test my skills by creating an over-the-top design for the Camaro I owned.

					<h2>Creation</h2>
					<h5>the process</h5>
					<p>
						My process for these is pretty straight forward, I usually use the same process for each vehicle design I do. For this project, I started with a base photograph of the car and then gathering images of the different parts and pieces that I wanted on the car. From there I manipulated the images and pieced it all together into a final car. After that I added different lighting and effects to make it all blend together. When that was completed I stitched together the background and blended all of the elements to make it look like a polished image.
