					<h2>Conception</h2>
					<h5>the inspiration</h5>
					<p>
						This project was created to really explore my photo retouching techniques. I wanted to create a fun project that was different than anything I had seen before. I was inspired after finding an old caricature that was drawn of me when I was younger. This made me want to try and create a real life caricature by manipulating real photos of real people.
					</p>
					<h5>the shoot</h5>
					<p>
						The shooting of these images was very simple and straightforward. I wanted to challenge myself with the retouching portion of the project. Therefore I created a very simple lighting setup using an iPhone and the overhead room light. I also used a very simple backdrop for my subjects. This allowed me to get the photos shot in a short amount of time, leaving lots of time for post processing.

					<h2>Creation</h2>
					<h5>the edit</h5>
					<p>
						Each photo was processed using the same techniques and workflow to keep a consistent look throughout the series. I started out by editing the facial features of each photo to really exaggerate certain features and turn them into their own unique characters. From there I cut out each head from the background and set each one to black to eliminate the backdrops. I really wanted to exaggerate the facial features and add more realism to each shot, so I used dodge and burn techniques to bring out different areas of the face. Then I added a faux shadow around the subject to make them look as though they are in a dark room with lighting just directed to the face. To finish up the images, I added a border, some sharpening, and a subtle grain to tie it all together.

					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<h5>the final shots</h5>
					<p>
						Here are three of the final shots that I produced for this project initially. I plan on continuing with the project and expanding it by creating more portraits in the future.
