					<h2>Premise</h2>
					<h5>the story</h5>
					<p>
						I wanted to try and create a story of the experience of a young soldier struggling after his time in the war. I am a big history geek and was very inspired by a war film I had watched. The main character went through some very traumatising experiences while at war. I tried to imagine what his life would look like upon returning to his regular life. This short was created to try and showcase how I believed he would be feeling.
